## Development

### Installation

#### For Users

To install the package for use:

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/uw-ssec/ovro-lwa-portal.git

# Or from a local clone
cd ovro-lwa-portal
pip install .
```

#### For Developers

##### Prerequisites

This project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) for dependency management. Install
Pixi by following the
[installation instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation), or use the
commands below:

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

##### Setup Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uw-ssec/ovro-lwa-portal.git
   cd ovro-lwa-portal
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Pixi:

   ```bash
   pixi install
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pixi run pre-commit-install
   ```

##### Development with pip

You can also develop using standard Python tools:

```bash
# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests

Run tests using pytest:

```bash
# With Pixi
pixi run pytest tests/

# Or with Python directly
pytest tests/
```

### Building the Package

To build the package locally:

```bash
python -m build
```

This will create wheel and source distributions in the `dist/` directory.

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify the package is installed correctly:

```bash
python -c "import ovro_lwa_portal; print(ovro_lwa_portal.__version__)"
```

### Configure pre-commit

PRs will fail style and formatting checks as configured by
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), but you can set up your local repository
such that precommit runs every time you commit. This way, you can fix any errors
before you send out pull requests!

#### Configure pre-commit to run on every commit

Then, once Pixi is installed, run the following command to set up pre-commit
checks on every commit

```bash
pixi run pre-commit-install
```

#### Manually run pre-commit on non-committed files

```bash
pixi run pre-commit
```

#### Manually run pre-commit on all files

```bash
pixi run pre-commit-all
```

### Access `ssec` CLI

The `ssec` CLI contains some convenience functions for setting up and working
with this repository. More information about the tool can be found here:
<https://github.com/uw-ssec/ssec-cli>

#### Set up autocompletions

```bash
pixi run ssec-setup
```

#### Run `ssec` command

```bash
pixi run ssec <options>
```

#### Run `ssec` command with autocompletion

Open Pixi shell

```bash
pixi shell
```

Start typing :)

```bash
ssec <tab>
```

## Working with Radio Astronomy Data

This project focuses on radio astronomy data processing. When contributing:

### Testing with Sample Data

Use the provided test FITS files in `notebooks/test_fits_files/` for development
and testing. These files represent typical OVRO-LWA observations.

### Jupyter Notebooks

- Notebooks are primarily for data exploration and analysis
- Keep notebooks clean and well-documented
- Use `nbstripout` or similar tools to remove output before committing

### Performance Considerations

- Use `dask` for large array operations that don't fit in memory
- Consider chunking strategies for Zarr arrays based on access patterns
- Profile memory usage when working with large datasets

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Image Plane Correction

When working with the `image-plane-correction` package:

- This is an external dependency from the OVRO-LWA team
- Currently using the `nikita/dev` branch
- Report issues to the upstream repository when appropriate

### BDSF Integration

For macOS ARM64 users:

- A pre-compiled wheel is provided to avoid compilation issues
- If you encounter problems, check the `pyproject.toml` configuration in the
  `[tool.pixi]` section
- Linux users should use the standard PyPI package

### Documentation

- Follow NumPy-style docstrings for functions and classes
- Include examples in docstrings when helpful
- Update README.md for significant changes to workflow or setup
